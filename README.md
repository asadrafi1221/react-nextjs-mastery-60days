# üöÄ 60-Day React & Next.js Mastery Roadmap

> **Goal**: Transform from a developer who "uses React" to someone who truly **understands** React and Next.js under the hood.

## üìã About This Challenge

This roadmap is designed for developers with 1.5 years of experience who want to level up from basic React usage to deep mastery. We're focusing on **fundamentals**, **performance optimization**, and **advanced concepts** - not just refactoring code!

**Duration**: 60 Days  
**Commitment**: 2-3 hours daily  
**Level**: Intermediate to Advanced
