# Day 1: Learning React & Next.js – Understanding the DOM, Virtual DOM, Fiber, and SEO

## 1. What is the DOM?

**DOM** stands for **Document Object Model**.
It represents the structure of an HTML document as a **tree of nodes** so that programming languages like JavaScript can manipulate it.

Example HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>My Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Hello, guys!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

* Each HTML element (like `<p>`) is a **node** in the DOM tree.
* The DOM allows scripts to **access, modify, and delete** these nodes.

---

## 2. How DOM Works

* The DOM is built using multiple **APIs**:

  * **HTML DOM API** – Provides support for HTML elements like `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<div>`.
  * **SVG DOM API** – Adds support for SVG elements and graphics.

---

## 3. `window` Object

* The `window` object is the **global object** in browsers.
* You can access the DOM via `window.document`.
* Since it’s global, you can simply use `document` without writing `window.document`.

---

## 4. Virtual DOM

The **Virtual DOM** is a lightweight **copy of the real DOM**.

Why it was created:

* In 2014, React developers noticed that even small changes (like updating a `<p>`) caused the entire DOM to be re-rendered.
* Virtual DOM solves this by **reducing direct manipulation** of the real DOM.

**How Virtual DOM works in React:**

1. React initializes the UI in the **Virtual DOM**.
2. When **state or props** change, React tracks the changes in the virtual DOM.
3. The **diffing algorithm** compares the previous virtual DOM with the updated one.
4. Only the necessary changes are applied to the **real DOM**, improving performance.

## 5. Fiber (Basics)

* Fiber is React's **reconciliation engine**.
* It helps **split rendering work into chunks**, making updates more efficient.
* Allows **interruptible rendering**, improving app responsiveness.

---

## 6. SEO Basics

**SEO (Search Engine Optimization)** is about making your site **search-engine-friendly**.

Key points:

* Use **semantic HTML tags**: `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`.
* Properly structure your content for readability and crawlers.
* Use relevant **meta tags**: `<title>`, `<meta description>`.
* Ensure accessibility (alt texts, headings hierarchy, etc.).

If you want, I can also make a **visual diagram of how real DOM, virtual DOM, and React diffing work**, which will make your notes much easier to revise.

Do you want me to create that diagram?
